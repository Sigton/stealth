# Stealth - Platformer

Stealth is a project I have been working on in Scratch for quite a long while now.
Since I have finished the Scratch version, I'm now working on one in python.

This version will run smoother and should have more features when it's finished.

## Current features
In the game currently are:
- Platforming physics
- Animated player
- Levels 1-10
- Keypads and doors
- Guards with torches

## Planned features
Coming soon is:
- A menu
- Armed guards
- Levels 11-13
- Level text
- Animations and intros/outros
- Sound effects
- Background Music
