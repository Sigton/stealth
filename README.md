# Stealth - Platformer

Stealth is a platforming adventure through an enemy occupied warehouse, and your goal is to destroy the facility.
By navigating the building, sneaking past the guards, avoiding the dangers, you'll make it to the heart of the warehouse where you need to plant bombs to destroy the place.
These bombs have a timer, however, so you need to make sure you get out again before the time runs out!
