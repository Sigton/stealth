# Stealth - Platformer

Due completion - Monday 17th April, 2017
After this date will be two weeks of testing, before this will be submitted as an entry to the BAFTA Young Games Designers Competition on the 1st of May.

### Description

Stealth is a platforming adventure through an enemy occupied warehouse, and your goal is to destroy the facility.
By navigating the building, sneaking past the guards, avoiding the dangers, you'll make it to the heart of the warehouse where you need to plant bombs to destroy the place.
These bombs have a timer, however, so you need to make sure you get out again before the time runs out!

### Known bugs:

- Collision detection between the player and torches is inaccurate when crouching


If you've found a bug, please make an issue about it.
