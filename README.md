# Stealth - Platformer

Stealth is a project I have been working on in Scratch for quite a long while now.

In the game currently are:
- Platforming physics
- Animated player
- Levels 1-10
- Keypads and doors
- Guards with torches
- Level text

Coming soon is:

  * options menu

- Pause menu
- Security guards
- Laser beams
